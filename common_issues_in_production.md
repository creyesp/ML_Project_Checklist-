Often, there were filters applied when gathering the data that are not applied during live scoring and vice-versa. If this is the case, performance might be lower than seen during training. Ideally, when deciding which data you will use for training, you spend a significant amount of time, understanding the population that will be entering into your model<br>* Corroborate that the target you used to train your model is a true representation of the real outcome. Often, we use targets with information that is not reliably updated / saved by the company. If target is not reliable, model performance might be lower than anticipated.<br>* Check that the model implementation satisfies your requirements. Are there any exceptions made to the population of data that is sent to your API? 	|
